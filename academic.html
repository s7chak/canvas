                <div><strong>The Masters program in Information Technology and Management is a hybrid between IT and Managerial courses, with a leaning towards technology and data science, if the student chooses to go in that direction. It is a course tailor-made for both technical people wishing to learn business and business folk wishing to dive deeper into technology. <br><br>Being in the tech world for the last five years it was a great find for me and my goal was not just to learn more about the business utility and application of technology but also to get a flavour of the latest technologies at the forefront of today's technological landscape. </strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>I must admit there are a lot of myths about this course, in that some think it does not go deep enough into technology and some also say it might not be about data science or analytics, but only about programming at a high-level, a bird's eye view if you will. My experience throughout the course paints a different picture busting these myths and it is always good to hear it from the MSITM horse's mouth when judging a course. I have to begin with the courses we encountered and how deep or shallow they truly were. Of course, I cannot explain all of a six-month course in a paragraph, but the topics themselves and timeframe tell their own stories.</strong></div><div><strong>Here are the classes that have lent me a tighter grip on software engineering and the world of data-driven insights.</strong><br></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><ol>
                    <li><strong>Advanced Programming and App development - </strong>This was a pure coding course involving introduction to Python and diving deeper into Numpy library. Next the focus was on pushing our built APIs and database to Google App Engine on the cloud for a backend. This step included creating a website to be deployed on the cloud as well that would use the APIs. To finish it off there was an app to be developed using Kotlin that used the Cloud database and APIs to perform actions on the data from Android phones.<br>The Technologies used:<br>Jupyter Notebook for <strong>Python</strong><br>Google's <strong>CloudSQLProxy</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong> database<br><strong>Flask</strong> for Website<br><strong>Kotlin</strong> on Android Studio<br><br></li><li><strong>Big Data and Distributed Programming</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> - The main focus of this course was to look atthe latest technologies we have today to parse through huge datasets and derive some insight out of them, some common theme or any predictive value, meaning if we can predict an output for certain given features of the data(essentially what machine learning is all about).<br></span>The Technologies used:<br>Python's <strong>Pandas</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> and </span><strong>Scikit-learn</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> libraries<br></span><strong>Apache Spark</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> - Resilient Distributed Datasets<br></span><strong>AWS </strong>-<strong> </strong>For running analyses on larger datasets using higher computing power<br>Some of the models used for machine learning - <strong>Perceptron and Adaline<br><br></strong></li><li><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Business Data Science - </strong>Data science is of no use without the proper statistical toolkit and mindset to approach problems. This course focuses on the algorithms, models and is pretty mathematics-heavy when it comes to approaching issues where a machine needs to learn hot to classify a huge amount of data, in order to predict the next set's label.&nbsp;<br>The Technologies used:<br></span>Python's <strong>Pandas</strong> and <strong>Scikit-learn</strong> libraries<br><br>Topics: Empirical Risk Minimization, True Error, Regression - Linear, Lasso, Ridge, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Boosting, Bagging<br><br></li><li><strong>Design Methods - </strong>A course covering the fundamentals of design thinking, how it is an iterative process with many steps that are unknown to outsiders. It provided an inside peek into the minds of designers and while designing a product on our own, my team and I felt quite in-the-zone following the steps of design. I began to notice good and bad design everywhere and it was a truly enlightening experience delving deeper into the process with each essay and step of the project.</li></ol><ol>
