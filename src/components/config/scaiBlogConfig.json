        "description": "I want to present some self-help, the only kind that does not make my blood ooze out of my skin and take a dive inside a lava lake. This, though, I find important enough; so much so that I made my own Learner’s Manifesto out of it. <br><br>If you truly wish to be that old, retired-but-not-done-learning, jack-of-all-trades, polymath one day sitting at a corner in a cafe, quietly assimilating some new random fact and forming insights on the cutting edge that our AI “workers” invent, read on.<br><br>* Curiosity is paramount, we’re not cats.<br>* Minds are malleable<br>* Acquiring a new skill is the hobby<br>* Critically check new ideas<br>* Challenge ingrained notions<br>* Diversify from the buffet of fields<br>* Learn from failing<br>* Share learned insight<br>* Stay humble<br><br> And that is it, some guard-rails and initial force to draw us out of our daily inertia.",
